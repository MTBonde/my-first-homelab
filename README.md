# My First Homelab

My first homelab — a hands-on journey into Linux, Docker, DevOps, and self-hosting.  
As a software development student learning DevOps in school, this project gives me a place to apply concepts, build confidence, and learn by doing.

## 🎯 Goals & Roadmap

I'm building this homelab from scratch to understand real-world infrastructure, deployment, and service management.

### ✅ Phase 1 — Baseline Setup *(Completed 2025-05-24)*
- Installed Ubuntu Server on old laptop
- Enabled SSH and static IP
- Installed Docker

### ⏳ Phase 2 — Security Hardening
- Harden SSH (keys only, no root)
- Set up firewall rules
- Consider fail2ban or similar
- Document threat model and decisions

### 🔜 Phase 3 — Remote Access & Deployment
- Set up Tailscale or WireGuard
- Test access from outside LAN
- Plan secure shutdown/startup process
